<h2>INNOVATION</h2>
<h4>By Thuc Anh</h4>

<p>Another hypothesis is that the <b>Student-centered philosophy approach should embrace an innovative learning environment. </b><i>The level of innovation, we suggested, shall be strongly related to a flexible curriculum, the faculty's style of leadership, learning interactions, and students' diverse experiences in and out of class.</i></p>
<p>Statistics started to show its limits when we touched on dived deep into each factor. For school's curriculum, we can only know the actual number of majors, not the indicators of the school's flexibility and effort of improving its program, such as the number of majors added every year. Unfortunately, there is no quantitative information about the faculty's style of leadership. For learning interactions, we tested the coefficient of the student-faculty ratio. Lastly, students' experiences are measured by the number of registered clubs and organizations, and the number of sports. Interestingly, the regression analysis reported no statistically significant variable in this trial (df=44, R2 = 0.029, t-statistics of the variables in order are -0.151, 0.016, 0.133, 1.113, 0.133).</p>
<p>Receiving such results, we went to the second trial, in which we touched on more conventional indicators such as acceptance rate, endowment per capita, full-time faculty, and social mobility rank. These are variables that show a strong correlation with the general ranking of the school. In this second trial, the result is slightly better than the first one when one out of four variables (acceptance rate) is statistically significant: 2.117, 1.240,1.596, 1.049, given df = 43 and R2 = 0.097.</p>
<p>The weak correlations between innovation and significant variables can be explained by the process of the US News ranking innovation. Quite similar to our analysis, the US News measured the aspects of curriculum, faculty, students, campus life, technology, or facilities. However, what they did is collecting the subjective evaluations of leaders of one school on other schools' performances: <i>"College presidents, provosts and admissions deans were asked to nominate up to 15 colleges or universities in their U.S. News Best Colleges ranking category that are making the most innovative improvements."</i> There are many obscurities in the US News' process: based on what framework the leaders judged other schools' performances; how the schools' performances are recorded and reported; whether the leaders' points of view are representative enough. The US News' reliance on subjective evaluations rather than a standard formula plays a crucial role in explaining our failed attempt to use data to explain the innovation ranking.</p>
<p>In short, our findings suggest that <i>we lack a systematic approach and data to evaluate the level of innovation of college.</i> While the importance of innovative learning is escalating, this ambiguous methodology of measuring innovation can prevent schools from transforming their program quickly and effectively. </p>
