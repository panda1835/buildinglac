<h3 style="text-align: justify;">What</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Building LACs is a research project aiming at finding the ideal recipe for a ideal liberal arts college (LAC).</p>
</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<h3>Why</h3>
<p>By answering the question of what makes an ideal LAC, this project can provide a good reference for launching a new LAC college in an unfamiliar context , or initiating change for a better LAC. Besides, despite having been a part of American and Western higher education since the 17th century (Jacob, 2020), liberal arts education remains novel and somewhat peculiar in Vietnam - where nearly 80% of higher education institutions (HEIs) are public schools, according to a government statistics in 2015. Thus, this project is expected to facilitate the adaptation of liberal arts education to the Vietnamese context.</p>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
<h3>How</h3>
<p>The conduct of this research includes 2 parts: (1) reviewing the current factors for a qualified higher education as well as a liberal arts college; and (2) analyze data collected from the U.S. News to synthesize a formula for a qualified LAC.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Results?</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our output is represented in 2 forms: (1) an interactive website allowing users to use their presumed data and examine the quality of that presumed LAC; and (2) a research paper.</p>
