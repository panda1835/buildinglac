<h2>SALARY OF ALUMNI</h2>
<h4>By Da Ly</h4>
</div>
<p> </p> 
<p>The given hypothesis is that the median starting salary of the alumni is affected by the percentage of 4-year graduation, the tuition and fees, and the student-faculty ratio.</p>
<p>Brief reasons for choosing these variables: It's fair to think that the tuition and fees that one invests in their higher education must contribute hugely to their salary after graduation. Besides, I believe the close relationship between faculty and students might foster the chances that students can find well-paid jobs. The chosen 4-year graduation percentage is supposed to indicate how ones seriously dedicate their time at college. </p>
<p>After running the regression, it turns out that only two of the hypothetical dependent variables are statistically significant, which are  the tuition and fees (p-value = 0.00063 ) and the percentage of 4-year graduation (p-value = 0.00136).</p>
<p>With the second regression, after removing two insignificant variables, the R-square value is 0.45024, meaning that roughly 45% of the data fits the trendline, and there is pretty good accuracy in the regression.</p>
<p >The equation now is:</p>
<p class = "center"><b>The Median starting salary of alumni = 0.000602284398461731 * [The tuition and fees] + 0.000653747235414125 * [The percentage of 4-year graduation] + 31827.5240653355</b></p>
<p>It's interesting that originally, the most expected variable is the faculty and students ratio, however, it turns out that it's the only statistically insignificant, out of three. My explanation for this result is that professors in liberal arts colleges are more "academic" than "practical", that they might not offer students hands-on experience in their profession (except for students who want to pursue academic career paths).</p>
<p>The positive coefficients of the two significant variables indicate how these predictors affect the expected outcome, as follows: Tuition and Fees (coefficient = 0.191517657) and 4-year graduation rate (coefficient = 12198.4512) mean that the higher tuition and fees, the higher 4-year graduation rate the school presents, the higher starting salary that alumni can achieve.</p>
<p>In short, our findings don't suggest a strong factor contributing to the salary of the alumni, it can't be said that it's hard to find this factor in reality. Yet there's another common consumption that students concerned about earning a good living should avoid learning the liberal arts, especially humanities and social sciences. Our hypothesis is not aiming to deny this consumption, however, it would be a worth-examining variable to test the median mid-career salary of alumni, instead of the median starting salary alumni like what our test did. </p>
