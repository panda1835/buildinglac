<h2>SOCIAL MOBILITY</h2>
<h4>By Hao</h4>
</div>
<p> </p> 
<p>The given hypothesis is that social mobility rank is affected by school type (i.e., whether the school is public or private), the median starting salary of alumni, school's endowment per capita, and the percentage of undergraduates who are the first generation. Since social mobility is "the ability to move from one level of society to another" (Cambridge dictionary), the social mobility rank emphasizes the likeliness of the college to help their students move up a level of society after attendance, in comparison with other existing colleges. Although this does not necessarily guarantee that which school does a better job than one another in social mobility (as there might lack necessary information of dependent variables or the school does not provide the accurate statistics, etc.), <i>the outcome gives a rough estimation of the position of the school in the social mobility ranking list</i>.</p>
<p>Regarding the hypothetical dependent variables, public schools might have specific governmental policies that ensure society moving upward. In contrast, private schools care about social mobility only because of fame and revenue. The median starting salary of alumni implies the annual average income that an alumnus could gain after attending the college (if the salary is high, the student is having a better job than his parents). However, this does not take into consideration the initial income of the student's family, which is used to compare with the student's income after graduation. The endowment per capita shows how much money the college is investing in each student: the higher the amount is, the better quality the student will have. On the other side, the endowment per capita does not show how efficient the schools are spending their money on every student or whether they only throw money out the window. Finally, the proportion of undergraduates who are the first generation reflects on whether the student is the first one in the family to receive higher education, and by this, we assume that education leads to upward social mobility.</p>
<p>After running the regression, it turns out that only two of the hypothetical dependent variables are statistically significant, which are the median starting salary of alumni (t-stat = 3.498175324) and the percentage of undergraduates who are first-generation (t-stat = -5.084340558). After removing two insignificant variables, the R-square value is 0.3195757651, meaning that 31.96% of the data fits the trendline. The equation now is:</p>
 
<p><b>Social Mobility Rank = 24.92706446 - 300.3347929 * [Undergraduates who are first generation] + 0.00307716946 * [Median starting salary of alumni]</b></p>
 
<p>According to the equation, the higher the percentage of undergraduates who are first-generation the lower the value of the social mobility rank is; in other words, the rank goes up when the percentage goes up. This tells us that when a student is the first generation to receive higher education, it helps the family move to an upper society level. Meanwhile, the higher the median starting salary of alumni, the worse the school's social mobility rank is. For every 10,000 dollars in starting salary, the rank goes down 31 units. This, however, is quite conflicting, and I have not thought of any reasons for this. As said, the starting salary hasn't taken into consideration the overall income of the students' family, so it is not an accurate dependent variable (the student's family could be millionaires while the student only has a starting annual salary of $30,000).</p>
<p>In this case, the school type has no impact on the social mobility rank since both types of schools need to work hard on helping the students move upward in the social level either for fame or for policies. Also, how much endowment the college spends on a student does not guarantee that he/she will get a well-paid job and move upward since it is an unconditional endowment. Or, in other words, the students have no obligation to pay back or to achieve a specific success in the future.</p>
<p>To sum up, it is not quite convincing that the social mobility rank is dependent on the percentage of undergraduates who are first-generation and the median starting salary of alumni due to the low R-squared value. Therefore, it requires more research in the future to prove this causal relationship to be true.</p>
