Formula of a top-ranking Liberal Arts College 
and its limitations in quality indication</h2>

<h6 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Abstract</strong></h6>
<p style="text-align: justify;font-size: 17px">This research paper attempts to find a formula that can measure the relative educational quality of any given liberal arts institution; which is expected to be represented by its ranking. Once found, the formula can be utilized in the process of building new liberal arts colleges (LACs) or adjusting existing programs. In the first stage of the research, our team focused on collecting data from usnews.com. The second stage involved conducting regression analysis for the data set and extracting statistically significant variables. After synthesizing the data, we came up with the final formulas for ranking of a LAC, including resources, qualified enrolled students, student life, quality student-teacher interaction, curriculum, diversity, graduation success, and costs. However, the correlation between a school&rsquo;s ranking and its actual ability to foster students&rsquo; development is still open for future research.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Introduction</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&ldquo;What makes a good liberal arts college?&rdquo;, it can be said that this question captures the whole point of why all the data analysis and compositions were made. In light of elucidating how liberal arts pedagogy differs from other traditional forms of higher education, various attributes will be taken into account for comparisons. However, just merely comparing does not suffice. Further steps need to be taken to find out what can be learned from other regular colleges, then proceed to decide which factors are significant and distinctive of a liberal arts education.&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Literature review</strong></h3>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;">Factors affecting the quality of a Higher Education Institution (HEI)</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Higher education institutions (hereafter referred to as HEIs), according to Britannica, include not only colleges and universities, but also all professional schools that provide preparation in diverse fields, such as law, theology, medicine, business. The idea plays behind the HEIs is the critical thought, as a means for students to transform taken-for-granted-kids into intellectual adults. &ldquo;Critical thought is educationally radical&rdquo; (Barnett, 1997). The critical thought enables institutions to adopt new teaching strategies where there is a change in the authority of teachers. According to Barnett, &ldquo;no teacher who places critical thinking at the center of her approach to teaching and learning can teach didactically as a general strategy&rdquo; (1997).&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Critical thinking not only leads to a shift in the pedagogical relationship; but also inspire the modern philosophy of education: student-center philosophy and leads to other factors that would make a successful HEI. First, it is leadership in HEI (Tsinidou, Gerogianis, &amp; Fitsilis, 2010). Educators emphasize the variety of leadership styles and behavior that are found to be effective in studies of higher education leadership. Second, mentorship plays an integral role in HEI to orient students towards their future. According to Gallup Alumni Survey, mentorship makes up 64% of a student's success. This leads to the smaller class size, the decrease in student-faculty ratio to improve the training quality, which brings more benefits for students.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Moreover, to improve student&rsquo;s classroom experience, there is a suggestion to enhance &ldquo;evaluation of communication and interaction skills in the classroom&rdquo; (Tsinidou, Gerogianis, &amp; Fitsilis, 2010). Third, schools facilities such as libraries to ensure the availability of textbooks and journals, or laboratories to open hands-on experiment&rsquo;s opportunities (Tsinidou, Gerogianis, &amp; Fitsilis, 2010). Furthermore, the number of majors is also one thing that students concern; they believe that elective modules are essential for their customized studies and &ldquo;get an insight into areas of specialization as early as possible&rdquo; (Tsinidou, Gerogianis, &amp; Fitsilis, 2010).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;<strong>Factors affecting the quality of a Liberal Arts College (LAC)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Of all the aforementioned factors, some of them can actually relate to those of a Liberal Arts College. In <em>Cultivating Critical Thinking: Insights From An Elite Liberal Arts College </em>by Lisa Tsui, critical thinking is considered a fundamental skill among faculties and executive boards: &ldquo;Critical, analytical thinking is the core objective of the college in its teaching enterprise&rdquo;. Therefore, they put attention and effort into cultivating this pivotal skill among their student body, and the results turned out excellent when students all responded they grew a lot after critical thinking being insinuated in the syllabuses.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Besides, leadership is also successfully implemented in liberal arts education, since they understand that students should also be provided with opportunities to practice leadership in real life such as internships, service-learning experiences, club activities, etc., and not just lectured pedagogically (Susan Elaine Murphy, Ronald E. Riggio, 2003).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another factor that liberal arts colleges have been well-practicing is mentorship. This does not only mean mentorship between students and professors but also among students themselves. In Tania Smith&rsquo;s <em>Integrating Undergraduate Peer Mentors into Liberal Arts Courses: A Pilot Study</em>, there are many examples from liberal arts colleges that ingeniously put students who excelled at some certain subject in a &ldquo;teacher&rsquo;s position&rdquo;. In fact, they acted as professors&rsquo; assistants. &ldquo;Their&nbsp;roles varied and included individual tutoring, help via email, online discussion facilitation, small group facilitation, in-class presentation and discussion facilitation, and extracurricular study groups. This integration into scheduled class activities resulted in participating students&rsquo; perception of enhanced learning.&rdquo; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Since liberal arts colleges go for student-centered philosophy, it is important to keep classrooms small-sized for better interactions among teachers and students, thus effectively enhancing academic performances. In addition, laboratories for experiments and libraries with varied scholastic documents should also be available to best meet students&rsquo; learning demands. However, this has always been quite a dilemma for liberal arts colleges, since with lower faculty and student ratio, the number of rooms, facilities, and salaries must increase, which means charging higher tuition fees. This is the reason why it is a popular belief that liberal arts education is only for the elites. But this myth has successfully been busted since those colleges also manage to grant high endowment per capita thanks to donations from organizations and enterprises. Therefore, competent but financially underprivileged students still have the opportunity to attend classrooms with student-centered teaching methods in liberal arts schools.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Nevertheless, the number of majors in liberal arts colleges is more limited compared to other regular tertiary educational institutions. With the number of majors only about 20, they offer a curriculum that &ldquo;does not cater to students&rsquo; concerns with the job market&rdquo;. Although it is said that alumni having received an interdisciplinary liberal arts education is much more well-rounded and prepared for an incessantly changing workplace, the undergraduates may encounter problems when their expertise in a particular field is not strong enough, and they end up not being able to compete with their professionally specialized peers.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In a nutshell, either positively or negatively, factors that affect Higher Education quality also definitely have some kind of influence on that of Liberal Arts Colleges. Generally speaking, the best solution for those who are still confused about which educational system they should choose is to closely contemplate and look into their inner self. A specialized or a liberal arts college, they both have their pros and cons. Thus, there is no one-size-fits-all definition for &ldquo;the best&rdquo; college. In fact, the most comprehensive definition of &ldquo;the best&rdquo; is the most suitable choice for each individual; which makes students&rsquo; interests a key factor determining the commitment to pedagogy of an institution.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;<strong>Other factors </strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Besides the above-mentioned factors, we have also visited researches and ranking systems and listed below other influential variables that we consider worth discussing.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">According to College Choice, the graduation rate makes up 7.5% and the retention rate (proportion of students who complete their programs) makes up 22.5% in a school&rsquo;s ranking. Other considerable factors that would promote learning experience are student diversity, including international students ratio (Top universities), ethnicity, and radical students (Ahmad, H., Francis, A. and Zairi, M.,2007; Terenzini, P., Cabrera, A., Colbeck, C., Bjorklund, S., &amp; Parente, J. ,2001). Enrollment between 1500 and 2000 students is also necessary for quality education (Bonvillian, G., &amp; Murphy, R 1996).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>*Graduation rate is the percentage of a school's first-time, first-year undergraduate students who complete their program within 150% of the published time for the program. Retention rate is the percentage of</em><em>&nbsp;a school's first-time, first-year undergraduate students who continue at that school the next year. (</em><a href="https://fafsa.ed.gov/help/fotw91n.htm"><em><u>https://fafsa.ed.gov/help/fotw91n.htm</u></em></a><em>)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Admission rate also plays an indispensable role (or 12.5%) in college ranking (College Choice, 2020) because it relates directly to the quality of the student pool. However, a lower admission rate does not always do good since it narrows down students&rsquo; access to higher education. Using random assignment of students who have both high and low incomes has been proven to be effective in bringing higher education to low-income students (Hoxby, Caroline, and Sarah Turner 2013).&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Hypothesis</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We suspect that a substantial concentration on students&rsquo; development is a strict prerequisite for a program, regardless of its teaching style, to be of high quality. Since education quality is abstract and inconsistent among various education models; in this research, we would choose ranking of a college - a widely recognized approach to find out &ldquo;the best school&rdquo; as the measurement of quality. Such a concentration on ranking shall be endorsed by the following aspects: resources, qualified enrolled students, student life, quality student-teacher interaction, curriculum, diversity, graduation success, and costs.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To be more specific, for a good graduation outcome, a need of qualified students with high scores on standardized tests or desirable characteristics shall be satisfied. To ensure a quality student-faculty interaction, a small ratio of student-faculty (less than 10), a high proportion of less-than-20 classes, and a significant quantity of full-time faculty must be secured. A strong curriculum with an adequate number of majors would result in successful graduates. Regarding costs, higher tuition fees shall warrant better conditions for a quality learning while higher financial aid packages shall lessen the burdens that might hinder students&rsquo; development. Resources such as endowment per capita should have a positive correlation with the general quality of the program. A dynamic student life should consist of a highly diverse student body and a large number of clubs and activities. Lastly, a quality program should induce a higher benchmark of median starting salary.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Analysis - </strong><strong><em>Ranking of a College </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The ranking of a college represents its academic quality, of which the definition and factors are determined according to the education philosophy of the organization. In this research, the data source is mainly provided by usnews.com; yet, we take a different approach to the classification of schools. Based on literature review and our hypothesis on what might affect a school ranking, we divide the measures into eight groups including: resources, qualified enrolled students, student life, quality student-teacher interaction, curriculum, diversity, graduation success, and cost. The variables of each group are as followed:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px; text-align: justify;">Resources: endowment per capita</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px; text-align: justify;">Enrolled students: acceptance rate, first year in top 10% HS, average SAT score</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px; text-align: justify;">Curriculum: number of majors</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px; text-align: justify;">Graduate success: median starting salary, social mobility ranking</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px; text-align: justify;">Cost: tuition</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px; text-align: justify;">Faculty interaction: faculty-student ratio</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px; text-align: justify;">Diversity: proportion of international students, proportion of out-of-state students, the ratio of male and female for both students and faculty, proportion of first-generation students.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px; text-align: justify;">Student life: number of registered clubs, number of sports</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After running the regression analysis for each variable, we sort out the most significant variables from each group by using t-test. While most of the groups can export the most significant variables - listed respectively as, endowment per capita, average SAT score, median starting salary of alumni, tuition, student-faculty ratio, proportion of first-generation students, and number of registered clubs; curriculum is the only group with no significant variable. &nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;Equation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Ranking = y = 384.67 - 0.001*[tuition] -1.48E-08*[endowment] + 0.0003*[median_starting_salary] + 67.1*[student_faculty_ratio] + 1.27*[first_gen_college] - 0.05*[registered_clubs] - 0.22*[average_sat_score]</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Overall, this equation addresses 7 factors that a liberal arts college needs to take into consideration for the enhancement of their school ranking. With a R square of 0.82, this formula appears to be moderately reliable for it being able to explain more than 80% of the correlation between those factors and school ranking. For the input measures, a LAC with a rich endowment, high tuition, a large number of registered clubs, a high average SAT score of enrolled students, a low faculty-student ratio, and a low proportion of first-generation college students would highly likely be classified as a top school. For the output measures, a program&rsquo;s quality is measured by its median starting salary of alumni.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Discussion</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Although such observation confirms our initial hypothesis, except for the impact of the learning curriculum, there are several remaining concerns.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;The first issue emerged is the possibility of a reversed causal effect. For example, while a larger endowment promises a better facilitation of students&rsquo; learning experience and hence a higher ranking of a school; the opposite can also happen when the top ranking schools are more likely to receive better endowment and attract more talents. Another concern is that a strong correlation does not guarantee an effective policy. While it is true that ranking strongly correlates with median starting salary, aiming at enhancing median starting salary does not necessarily improve a program&rsquo;s quality. Furthermore, the suggested factors do not indicate the school&rsquo;s value-added measures. Indeed, one of the reasons why top schools often induce higher starting salaries is that they only admit accomplished students, who would succeed in life regardless of their school.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The gap between school&rsquo;s ranking and school&rsquo;s value-added results from the inconsistency in defining the purpose of education. Although the ranking system suggests a way to estimate the quality of a school; it simultaneously forces the education system to follow a specific definition or set of standards. Hence, while this equation indicates the factors weighted the most for the ranking of a LAC; it may not be the perfect recipe for a LAC that fits all definitions of a quality education. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Limitations</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is observed that the factors for a top-ranking LAC differ from the factors we have reviewed and expected; which is inevitable for several reasons. First, we lacked the data sources for some concepts discussed in the Literature Review such as Student Leadership since these factors have yet been studied. Second, we failed to find statistically significant variables for some factors such as Innovation because these were originally ranked based on a separate data pool, i.e. schools&rsquo; peer assessment, which is not accessible. Third, as our main data source is <em>usnews.com</em>, we are bound by their perception of education quality. Hence, as we try a different approach with our own assumption, it is possible to have omitted-variable bias. &nbsp;</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Future Recommendation</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Researchers interested in the topic are invited to find new statistically significant variables of the seven groups of factors to create different paths of improving education quality. However, as pointed above, our paper has stopped at finding the correlation between the seven factors and a school ranking. We suggest future research studying the correlation between a school&rsquo;s ranking and its actual value-added score and studying particularly the contribution of these seven factors to students&rsquo; development.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Determining what makes a good liberal art college is neither a simple nor straight-forward task. So far, the factors that we have taken into account to decide educational quality in the form of a school ranking are just moderately accurate. Since there may be institutions with lower overall ranking but possess some better attributes compared to the higher-ranked ones; which implies an inconsistency of the definition and standards to &ldquo;rank&rdquo; school performance. Besides, current research has yet to provide a holistic encapsulation of the bigger picture as there still remains other aspects within a liberal arts institution that lack solid data for analysis. It also points out the shortfall in measuring the impact of a college on a student&rsquo;s development. Therefore, the journey is still open ahead for further investigations. Though not completely comprehensive, however, results yielded from up-close evaluations so far are still helpful in providing fascinating insights into the world of liberal arts.</p>
