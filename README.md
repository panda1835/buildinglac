This repository features our final project (a mini research) in the course "Understanding the World through Statistics" taught by Dr. Graeme Walker at Fulbright University Vietnam in Spring 2020.

In this research project, we tried answering the following questions:
- What are main factors that influence the rankings of liberal arts colleges in the US? 
- Based on the findings, what factors should a young liberal arts university focus on to be on a good ranking in the standings of international liberal arts institutions?

The original idea of this research was to investigate various aspects of high education institution (e.g. tuition and fees, number of students/class, student faculty ratio, number of clubs, gender proposition ...). Our research subject focuses on American libral arts college. The final result will be used to inform the leadership and stakeholders of what important aspect that a new high education instution like Fulbright University Vietnam should consider and prioritize in the early years of its establishment. It is important to balance its identity as both American-education and for-Vietnam while maintains the coherence between traditional education approach and innovative teaching method.

This research is made possible by a group of students in the course and under supervision of Dr. Graeme Walker, professor of Economics at Fulbright University Vietnam.
